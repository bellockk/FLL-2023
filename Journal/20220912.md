# FLL Orientation (2022/09/12)

**Welcome to the 2022-2023 season of First Lego League at Old Mill Middle School South!!**

This was our first meeting to kick off the new season and we made new friends and saw the new game boards for this year's competition!  Very exciting!!

I recommend reading this again with the team members you are responsible for so that we are all on the same page with expectations for the season.  You can also reference it as needed as we progress through the season, and forward to anyone who may have been missed or who you think might be interested in joining our club.

## Head Coach:

My name is Ken Bellock, and I'll be the head coach for this season's FLL teams.  I have a B.S. in Mathematics and Physics from Penn State, and a M.S. in Geographic Information Systems from Johns Hopkins.  In the past I worked for the space program as a contractor designing ascent aborts scenarios for the Space Shuttle.  For my current job I lead a team of Embedded Software Engineers who automate tests on satellite systems before we deploy them to space.

## OMMS Sponsor:

This is a parent led club, but it would not be possible without Mrs. Hartman!  She coordinates the creation of the teams, and provides us with: a space to practice, robots, legos, and game boards.  Thank you Mrs. Hartman!!

## Coaching Help is Needed!

We have several returning assistant coaches this year, but we need more!  If you are interested in helping out with coaching please contact me and we can talk about how you can contribute.  Any and all help will be appreciated.  You do not need to know anything about coding or building with legos to help out, and we are required to have at least two coaches per team we field during competition.

## Meeting Schedule:

Mondays 6-8pm except when the school is closed and on Halloween Usually early after the new year we have competition (I do not know dates yet) If we win a bracket, we move up and will have another day of competition.  Before competition we will meet on the weekends at a coach or parents house to develop our robot game and presentation.  These are not required meetings, but are a lot of fun and very helpful for last minute preparations for competion.

* Robot Missions Overview: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILTjo0LHZQA>

### Game Rules

* Have Fun!
* Students must do ALL of the work, coaches only provide guidance
* Competition consists of the robot challenge, a core values presentation, a conversation with judges about robot design, and an innovation project presentation
* [Official Rulebook for Robot Competition.](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-energize/fll-challenge/fll-challenge-superpowered-robot-game-rulebook.pdf)
* [Rubric for Presentations.](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-game-changers/fll-challenge/Rubrics.pdf)

## Interesting Notes:

* We are competing against over 35k teams through multiple brackets
* We have never made it to the next level, but last year one of our teams got real close, and every year we get better

## Required Commitment:

* FLL is a team sport.  Missing a meeting will hurt your team just like any other team sport.
* If you are not sure yet if you want to commit, please keep coming to the next several meetings to help decide.
* A commitment should be made by early October as that is when we will create the teams that will work together until competition.
* If you have days you know you will miss, please let us know as far in advance as possible.
* If too many days are missed, a critical role on competition day cannot be guaranteed.

## Behavioral and Team Work Expectations aka "Gracious Professionalism":

It's more than just good sportsmanship, it's treating our teammates and opponents with respect, cooperation and professional behavior including produtive communication skills.  Words matter.
Part of the robot competition score is an evaluation of behavior.
To practice on getting the highest score for this part of the evaluation we are going to practice "Gracious Professionalism" at all of our team meetings.
To keep us on track, we will be using a "three strikes" system, like in baseball

### Strike 1:

Warning and conversation about the behavior.  Club member sorts Legos the rest of the meeting

### Strike 2:

Address behavior, parent call home and club member sorts legos for the remainder of the meeting. At the next meeting your parent or guardian will accompany you and stay throughout the club meeting.

### Strike 3: 

Conversation with parent or guardian.  Loss of membership in the club.  Member will be asked to not return.

### Aditional Notes:

* If you will not sort legos the rest of the meeting on your first strike, you will get your second strike.
* Every club attendance showing "gracious professionalism" will cross off one of your strikes if you have one.
* There will be no warnings prior to a strike.  On competition day you will not get warnings, just point deductions.
* If you get a strike during cleanup at the end of the day you will sort legos the next meeting
* Finally, any major incidents that threaten the safety or well being of any team member or coach may result in immediate suspension from the club.  Team members who display and escalate behaviors that involve name calling, bad language, bullying, puposeful destruction of robots or supplies, theft or physical altercations may be released immediatly from FLL club participation.
* Examples of behaviors that are considered a strike:
  * Snatching, pushing, shoving, physical altercations
  * Yelling, name calling (with disrespectful intent), inappropriate or vulgar language
  * mistreating robots, boards, legos or laptops
  * Not cooperating or ignoring directions from coaches or Mrs. Hartman

## Laptops:

OMMS pays for registration, Legos, robots, and gives us space to practice, but the laptops we are currently using have been donated.  We could use a few more laptops if anyone has old laptops that are not being used.  If you have laptops you do not use anymore, please consider donating them to the team. They can be old, but must be working.  Any donated laptops will not be returned after the season ends.  Students can bring their own laptops, but we will not be responsible for lost, stolen or broken laptops.  I will send out instructions on how students can contribute from home if they would like to.  Any donated laptops will be wiped clean and we will reinstall the operating system and the Lego software

## Phones:

No phones are allowed out during meetings. You can bring them, but you cannot have them out unless messaging a parent or guardian.

## What Else To Bring To Meetings:

Send water bottles and snacks if you like.

## Fees:

There are no registration or participation fees, but we will likely take a collection as competition nears to get team shirts made.  (If you can make or design shirts and are willing, please let us know.)  Thank you to Jacen Scarberry's family who kindly helped us last year!

## Final Notes:

Legos, robots, missions and boards stay at school.

If you have any questions please let me know.  You can email me or we can talk before or after meetings.

This is going to be a great season!
