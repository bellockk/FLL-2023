# Main Research Points
## Idea 1- Heated Power Lines
* Pros
  * Ice won't build up during the winter
  * Prevents wires from freezing 
  * Lower cost
  * Easily spot damage
  * Less radiation
  * Helps make wires last longer
  * Extra coating of protection

* Cons
  * Adds weight, which causes sagging
  * Electrocution
  * Easily damaged
  * Better, efficient, and inexpensive batteries 
* Find research sources



* 
## Second idea- Wireless Transmission
* Pros
  * Increased effeciency
  * cost savings
  * No cables or wire
  * Accessible anywhere, any time
  * Faster 

* Cons
  * Minimum range
  * Security
  * Environmental impacts (radiation, etc.)

## RESEARCH
* WHAT COUNTRIES ARE ALREADY USING WIRELESS ENERGY? 
  * New Zealand launches (Long-range wireless power transmission)
* COMPONENTS OF WIRELESS SYSTEM
* Power Source
* A transmitting Antenna
* Transmitting Relays
* Rectenna
* Energy density is relatively low
* The distance is 1 kW per each square meter
* If the transmission works correctly the beam won't touch anything but air.
* The system has a net of lasers surrounding the beam to detect obstructions, like a bird or person, the transmission automatically shuts off until the obstruction moves out of the way. 

## Solar Satellite Transmission

* Satellites convert sunlight into energy composed of microwaves. 
* Microwave signals would be transmitted to an antenna or a main grid station.

## How much will it cost to license and build the wireless power technology or purchase the hardware?

* We are not sure yet as New Zealand has not opened up about the costs. Not everyone can do this.

## MORE INFO

* The New Zealand company running the long-distance wireless power transmission explained that the technology uses electromegnetic waves to transfer the power using a receiving antenna and a transmitting antenna.
* Wireless transmission has many more pros. The company explained that the new technology could help transmit renewable energy from one place to another at much lower costs compared to traditional methods.
* The system New Zealand is currently building can transmit only a few kilowatts. But, they can use the same technology to transmit over 100 times more power over a much longer distance.
