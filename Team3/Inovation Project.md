# Main Research Points
## Idea 1- Heated Power Lines
* Pros
* * Ice won't build up during the winter
* * Prevents wires from freezing 
* * Lower cost
* * Easily spot damage
* * Less radiation
* * Helps make wires last longer
* * Extra coating of protection

* Cons
* * Adds weight, which causes sagging
* * Electrocution
* * Easily damaged
* * Better, efficient, and inexpensive batteries 
* Find research sources



* 
## Second idea- Wireless Transmission
* Pros
* * Increased effeciency
* * cost savings
* * No cables or wire
* * Accessible anywhere, any time
* * Faster 

* Cons
* * Minimum range
* * Security
* * Environmental impacts (radiation, etc.)

## RESEARCH
* WHAT COUNTRIES ARE ALREADY USING WIRELESS ENERGY? 
* * New Zealand launches (Long-range wireless power transmission)
# Research
* COMPONENTS OF WIRELESS SYSTEM
* * Power Source
* * A transmitting Antenna
* * Transmitting Relays
* * Rectenna
# Research
* * Energy density is relatively low
* * The distance is 1 kW per each square meter
* If the transmission works correctly the beam won't touch anything but air.
* * The system has a net of lasers surrounding the beam to detect obstructions, like a bird or person, the transmission automatically shuts off until the obstruction moves out of the way. 

## Solar Satellite Transmission
* * Satellites convert sunlight into energy composed of microwaves. 
* * Microwave signals would be transmitted to an antenna or a main grid station.

## How much will it cost to license and build the wireless power technology or purchase the hardware?
* * We are not sure yet as New Zealand has not opened up about the costs. Not everyone can do this.
