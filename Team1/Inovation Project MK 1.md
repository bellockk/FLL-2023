# Main Research Points
## Idea 1 - Solar Power
## Solar power pros 

* Is renewable
* Garunteed to work during a set time in the day
* Does not emit pollution
## Find solar power weaknessess
* * Expensive to make
* * Hard to Implement 
* * Only works during during the day
* * takes a lot of space
   * 

* Find ways to solve or bypass weaknesses
* * Try to encourage more people to use solar
* * Use cheaper metals in production
* * More compact and efficient design 
* * Better, efficient, and inexpensive batteries 
* Find research sources
1.  Meet with expert in field to validate our solutions
1. Go to trusted internet sources
1. ask experts online
1. go to Youtube 
1. get ideas from coaches

## Second idea
* Weaknesses of wind power
* * wind isn't garunteed to be there
* * does need a lot of space
* * takes a lot of resources to make
* * not that efficent conpared to nuclar
* find ways to bypass the weakness
* * use another resource
* * create external wind source (man made wind)
* * more powerful wind sources
  * the
## third idea- HydroElectric Power
Cost = 2,100 usd per kilowatt
* Pro's of hydroelectricity
It is the most efficient power source: at 90% efficiency

Does not use fossil fuels: does not pollute

### cons

* Hurts the environment by blocking the natural flow of rivers

* Rivers are limited, and cannot be fully tapped into

* In some countries that are arid 

* 
 ## guidelines:

  Is it realistic

  Is it cost efficient

  does the idea already exist

  have you contacted someone in industry
  
  # Technology

* Materials to produce
* the space to produce the stuff
* 


# Tasks/assignments
## contact list
* Justin: Contact mechnanical engineer at ford.
   
   
* Ivan: Talk to electrical engineers

What are some common challenges with implementing renewable energy? 

Any idea's onto how renewable energy can be made cheaper?

Why haven't we made this change sooner?
