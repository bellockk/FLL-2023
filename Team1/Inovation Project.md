# Main Research Points
## Idea 1 - Solar Power
* Find solar power weaknessess
* * Expensive to make
* * Hard to Implement 
* * Only works during during the day
* * takes a lot of space

* Find ways to solve or bypass weaknesses
* * Try to encourage more people to use solar
* * Use rarer metals in production
* * More compact and efficient design 
* * Better, efficient, and inexpensive batteries 
* Find research sources
1.  Meet with expert in field to validate our solutions
1. Go to trusted internet sources
1. ask experts online
1. go to Youtube 
1. get ideas from coaches

## Second idea
* Weaknesses of wind power
* * wind isn't garunteed to be there
* * does need a lot of space
* * takes a lot of resources to make
* * not that efficent conpared to nuclar
* find ways to bypass the weakness
* * use another resource
* * create external wind source (man made wind)
